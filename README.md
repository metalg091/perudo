# Perudo
A website to play Perudo online.

# Plans

- Create backend (using uWebSockets)
    - In theory, the game is playable already
- Create frontend (plain HTML, CSS, JS)

# Contributing
If you create other source files to the backend, update the Makefile (I don't know how that works yet).
