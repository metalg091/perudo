I started this with the purpose of learning c#, but when i finished the game, I thought It would be fun to play it online with friends from a browser. So I learnt php and javascript and made a website for it. I know its a beginners work and it will be full of limitations and vunerablilities, but it was built with the purpose of private play! Feel free to use it!!!
