I started this with the purpose of learning c#, but when I "finished" the game, I thought It would be fun to play it online with friends from a browser. So I learnt php and javascript and made a website with online multiplayer in mind. (website is no longer online) Feel free to use it!!!
Currently my plans are making the game, yet again, in c++ then making a graphical front end both for linux and windows.
